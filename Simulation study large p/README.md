## Simulation Study (with Frobenius norm scenario)

This folder contains scripts to reproduce the simulation results (with Frobenius norm scenario; `p>n`; here `p` is equivalent to `d` as in manuscript) reported in the manuscript. The simulations are organized by method and followed by a summary step.
