## Simulation Study (with Gaussian likelihood scenario)

This folder contains scripts to reproduce the simulation results (with Gaussian likelihood scenario; `p<n`; here `p` is equivalent to `d` as in manuscript) reported in the manuscript. The simulations are organized by method and followed by a summary step.

### Method: BLOC

**Step 1.1**  
Run `Simulation_BLOC.m` for problem sizes `(p,n) = (20,50), (50,100), (100,150)`, with covariance types `Ctype = 'Blockdiag'` and `Ctype = 'SparseUniform'`, and penalty choices specified by `methods_to_perform = 4` (SCAD) and `methods_to_perform = 5` (MCP).

**Step 1.2**  
The script `Simulation_BLOC.m` executes 10 experiments simultaneously and may be time-consuming for larger problem sizes (e.g., `(p,n) = (100,150)`).  
To reduce computational burden, users may alternatively run a subset of experiments using `Simulation_BLOC_OneRep.m` by setting `reps_to_do` to any subset of `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`.  
Before proceeding to the summary stage, ensure that all 10 experiments have been completed for each penalty type (SCAD and MCP) and each covariance structure (`Blockdiag` and `SparseUniform`).

### Method: SpCov

**Step 2** 

Run `SpCov.R` (update work directory to be same as the location of this file)  for problem sizes `(p,n) = (20,50), (50,100), (100,150)` and covariance types `Ctype = "Blockdiag"` and `Ctype = "SparseUniform"`.  
Under our simulation settings, `SpCov` may take a long time to converge or may encounter errors for the `(p,n) = (100,150)` scenario.

###Results Aggregation

**Step 3.1**  
(Skip this step if `Simulation_BLOC_OneRep.m` was not used.)  
The outputs generated by `Simulation_BLOC_OneRep.m` are aggregated into a single file for each penalty type (SCAD and MCP) and covariance structure (`Blockdiag` and `SparseUniform`) by running `Summary_single_reps.m` for the corresponding `(p,n)` settings.

**Step 3.2**  
Finally, run `Summary.m` to generate all final output tables as reported in the main manuscript.
